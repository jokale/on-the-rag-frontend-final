           <h1>So you have a heavy flow?</h1>

           <h4>Again self explantory your bleed quite heavily whilst on your period with your period potentially lasting longer than 8 days! <br></br>whilst this may not always be the case please do check with a GP if you have any other underlying symptoms :)</h4>
          
          <h3> How do you know you have one?</h3>

          <h4>It's difficult to define exactly what a heavy period is because it varies from woman to woman. Heavy for 1 woman may be normal for another. Most women will lose less than 16 teaspoons of blood (80ml) during their period, with the average being around 6 to 8 teaspoons. Heavy menstrual bleeding is defined as losing 80ml or more in each period, having periods that last longer than 7 days, or both.

But it's not usually necessary to measure blood loss. Most women have a good idea of how much bleeding is normal for them during their period and can tell when this changes. <br></br> A good indication that your periods are heavy is:

<ul>

    <li>You are having to change your sanitary products every hour or 2
</li>
    <li> You are passing blood clots larger than 2.5cm (about the size of a 10p coin)
</li>
    <li>
     You are bleeding through to your clothes or bedding
   
    </li>
    <li>You need to use 2 types of sanitary product together (for example, tampons and pads)
</li>
</ul>
</h4>

<h3>What can cause a heavy period?</h3>

<h4>In about half of women with heavy menstrual bleeding, no underlying reason is found.

But there are several conditions and some treatments that can cause heavy menstrual bleeding.

Some conditions of the womb and ovaries can cause heavy bleeding, including:
<ul>

    <li>Fibroids – non-cancerous growths that develop in or around the womb and can cause heavy or painful periods
</li>
    <li>Endometriosis – where the tissue that lines the womb (endometrium) is found outside the womb, such as in the ovaries and fallopian tubes (although this is more likely to cause painful periods)
</li>
    <li>Adenomyosis – when tissue from the womb lining becomes embedded in the wall of the womb; this can also cause painful periods
</li>
    <li>Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) – an infection in the upper genital tract (the womb, fallopian tubes or ovaries) that can cause symptoms like pelvic or abdominal pain, bleeding after sex or between periods, vaginal discharge and a high temperature
</li>
    <li>Endometrial polyps – non-cancerous growths in the lining of the womb or cervix (neck of the womb)
</li>
    <li>Cancer of the womb – the most common symptom is abnormal bleeding, especially after the menopause
</li>
    <li>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) – a common condition that affects how the ovaries work; it causes irregular periods, and periods can be heavy when they start again
</li>
<br></br>
Other conditions that can cause heavy periods include:
<br></br>


    <li>Blood clotting disorders, such as Von Willebrand disease
</li>
    <li>An underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) – where the thyroid gland does not produce enough hormones, causing tiredness, weight gain and feelings of depression
</li>
    <li>Diabetes</li>


</ul>

<h3>When to see a doctor?</h3>

<h4>Seek medical help before your next scheduled exam if you experience:

    <ul>
        <li>Vaginal bleeding so heavy it soaks at least one pad or tampon an hour for more than two hours
</li>
        <li>Bleeding between periods or irregular vaginal bleeding
</li>
        <li>Any vaginal bleeding after menopause</li>

    </ul>
